# AquaSeal

## About the project
AquaSeal is a practical tool designed to simplify the understanding of water quality. It is a website integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) that analyzes user-provided data and delivers clear and objective results. The project was developed as part of an application for a university assignment.

## Instructions for Use
1. Access the website: https://anna-olyvera.github.io/Projeto-AquaSeal/

2. You should navigate through the website to the "Water Quality Test" section.

3. Now, just provide the required information. If you donâ€™t have some of the data, no problem! You can leave it blank, and the AI will analyze our database to generate a default value as a substitute.
