# AquaSeal

## About AquaSeal
AquaSeal is a practical tool designed to simplify the understanding of water quality. It is a website integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) that analyzes user-provided data and delivers clear and objective results. The project was developed as part of an application for a university assignment.

## Instructions for Use
1. Access the website: https://anna-olyvera.github.io/Projeto-AquaSeal/

2. You should navigate through the website to the "Water Quality Test" section.

3. Now, just provide the required information. If you don’t have some of the data, no problem! You can leave it blank, and the AI will analyze our database to generate a default value as a substitute.
